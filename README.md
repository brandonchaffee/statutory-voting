## Dependencies
NodeJS ([installation instruction](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

## Build and Test
Once NodeJS has been install, run an installation of the project with its proper dependencies. Finally, run the tests on the projects. This will create a personal blockchain using Ganache. Alternatively, the Ganache application can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases).

```sh
npm install
npm run test
```

If you are using Windows and encounter an error attempting to locate the test script run the following instead:

```sh
npm run test-windows
```
